## 🔬 Model Performance on Test Data

The **SVM model** was evaluated on a test dataset containing **102 patient biopsy records**, achieving an **accuracy of 95.74% (0.9574)**.

### 📊 Performance Breakdown:
- **True Positives (TP):** Malignant cases correctly classified as malignant.  
- **True Negatives (TN):** Benign cases correctly classified as benign.  
- **False Positives (FP):** Benign cases incorrectly classified as malignant.  
- **False Negatives (FN):** Malignant cases incorrectly classified as benign.  

Out of **102 test cases**, the model misclassified **3 benign cases as malignant (False Positives - FP)** while correctly classifying **99 cases (TP + TN)**.

## 💻 AI-Powered Breast Cancer Diagnosis – Web App Demonstration

### 🔹 Application Features  

The app offers two prediction options:  

- **Batch Prediction** 📂  
  Users can upload a CSV file containing multiple patient records with the required features. The app processes the data and returns a modified CSV file with an additional column indicating the diagnosis (**Malignant** or **Benign**) for each patient.  

- **Individual Prediction** ✍️  
  Users can manually input patient data, and the app instantly provides a diagnosis (**Malignant** or **Benign**).
